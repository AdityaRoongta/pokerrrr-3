# Production release

Production is `dunzo-club`, at https://dunzo-club.arun-devanathan.workers.dev/.
It serves the same client and multiplayer server as staging, built with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production` and `APP_ENV=production`. Practice, preview and
simulated-history controls are hidden. Server-side simulated history and reset
operations are staging-only.

## Isolation

`wrangler.production.jsonc` declares a local `ClubTable` binding with its own
SQLite namespace, created on first deployment by `dunzo-club-v1`. The object name
is still `dunzo-club`, but namespaces are separate between Workers. Never add
`script_name` pointing at staging, rename the production Worker/namespace, delete
its storage, or import staging games. Production starts with an empty roster and
history. Provision real players using [PLAYERS.md](PLAYERS.md) against the
**production** namespace. Do not copy browser sessions, test accounts or game data.

## Validation

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:staging
pnpm test:production
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build:production
pnpm check:production
pnpm test:production:smoke
```

The production smoke test uses disposable local storage and cannot target remote
URLs. It checks the actual production artifact, login, private WebSockets,
reconnect/restart, chip reconciliation, no practice button in the rendered lobby,
403 responses for simulated history/settlement, and absence of staging-only tables.
CI builds and dry-runs production; it does not deploy.

## Cloudflare Builds

Connect `arundevanathan/pokerrrr-3`, branch `main`, root `/`, Node >=22.13.0 and
pnpm 11.25.0. Build command: `pnpm run build:production`.

Use `pnpm run deploy:production` only for the initial deployment (which creates
the namespace), or an explicitly approved migration release. After initial setup,
set the Cloudflare deploy command to `pnpm run upload:production`: pushes save a
candidate version without replacing the live version. Disable branch Preview
builds. Staging continues deploying automatically with its existing commands.

To release, identify and test the exact commit in staging, select the corresponding
production version under Deployments, and promote it to 100% traffic. Avoid
splitting traffic between game-server versions. If a namespace migration is needed,
review its compatibility separately; versions upload does not apply migrations.
Always build the intended environment immediately before upload/deploy because
both builds overwrite `dist/`. Guards reject the wrong environment or shared
storage bindings. The generated config already selects the environment; do not
pass `--env` to the generated artifact.

Verify `/api/health` reports environment `production`, the expected commit and
`multiplayerReady: true`. Before inviting players, verify login from two devices,
phone background/reconnect and the installed app at the production URL. An empty
roster is intentional until player records are provisioned.

For recovery, redeploy a known compatible previous version, preserving the Durable
Object namespace. Code rollback does not undo saved games or database migrations.
Keep release commit/version identifiers for support and reconciliation.
