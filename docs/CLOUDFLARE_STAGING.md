# Dunzo Club on Cloudflare

## One app, one URL

`dunzo-club-staging` serves the browser client and the authoritative multiplayer
server at https://dunzo-club-staging.arun-devanathan.workers.dev/.
The GitHub repository remains **arundevanathan/pokerrrr-3**. Preserve both existing
resource identifiers when changing the app's display name.

The Worker exports `ClubTable`, a SQLite-backed Durable Object. One fixed object
name (`dunzo-club`) owns the group's active-session pointer, room snapshots,
command receipts and archived hands/completed sessions. A single transaction saves
an accepted action, its retry receipt and alarm. Alarms continue while every phone
is disconnected. WebSockets receive individually filtered views; no raw deck or
other player's bearer identity is broadcast. HTTP mutations carry protocol version,
command ID, state version and hand ID. Writes are acknowledged only after storage.

## Local verification

Use Node >=22.13.0 and the packageManager pnpm version. No auth secret or
`.dev.vars` is required. Players are inserted into the coordinator's SQLite
`players` table; see [PLAYERS.md](PLAYERS.md).

```sh
pnpm test
pnpm test:staging
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build:staging
pnpm check:staging
pnpm test:staging:smoke
```

The automated smoke test supplies its own disposable player accounts and database,
checks HTTP and private WebSocket updates, restarts the server against that same
local database, waits for a server alarm without client requests, then cleans up.
It refuses remote URLs. Use `pnpm dev:staging` for HMR or `pnpm preview:staging`
for the built Worker. Local testing does not provision or migrate remote storage.

## Deployment configuration

The existing `ClubTable` namespace was introduced by the `dunzo-club-v1`
`new_sqlite_classes` migration. Keep that namespace and migration unchanged.
There is no automatic import from the original Site/D1 database. No D1, R2,
connector or production bindings are allowed in the staging artifact. Never
repurpose a real player's historical balance as staging test data.

Player authentication uses the existing namespace, with additive `players` and
`player_sessions` SQL tables initialized when the object starts. There is no new
namespace or binding migration for PIN login. Existing game/history keys stay
unchanged. Provision player records before signing in. When mapping an existing game to
player accounts, follow [PLAYERS.md](PLAYERS.md). Local builds do not modify live records.

Cloudflare build configuration:

- Repository: `arundevanathan/pokerrrr-3`, branch `main`, root `/`.
- Build: `pnpm run build:staging`.
- Deploy: `pnpm run deploy:staging`.
- Runtime: Node 22 (>=22.13.0), pnpm 11.25.0.

The build selects `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=staging` before the Vite plugin runs. The generated
`dist/server/wrangler.json` already contains the selected environment: do not pass
`--env` or alternate binding overrides when deploying it. `dist/` is overwritten
by each build; always rebuild staging before deploying staging. The artifact guard
requires the expected Worker name/environment, one local `ClubTable` binding and
its SQLite migration, and rejects D1, R2 and service bindings. Compatibility date
remains 2026-05-15 for the pinned Wrangler/workerd runtime.

GitHub CI validates builds and performs a dry-run; it does not deploy. Cloudflare's
Git integration may deploy automatically after merge and is an independent pipeline.
Check its state before merging. A production environment, its secrets and storage
must be separately provisioned; never rename this staging namespace to production.

## Release checks and recovery

- `/api/health`: app `Dunzo Club`, environment `staging`, expected commit,
  `mode: multiplayer`, and actual `multiplayerReady`.
- Lobby/installed app show Dunzo Club. Sign-in requires an enabled player and their four-digit PIN;
  unrelated origins and requests without a valid player session are rejected.
- Two independent browser profiles can join, see only their own cards, act,
  refresh/resume and see synchronized versioned state.
- Only one session can be active. End it between hands, start a new one and reopen
  the old session with its original player identity; its results must remain.
- Test phones backgrounded, offline/reconnected and a server restart before real
  use. Confirm all chips and final cash-outs reconcile.

## Persistent state

Preserve the existing Durable Object namespace and SQLite migration when deploying
or rolling back code. Deleting or recreating the namespace changes the app's data
store. Use schema-compatible code for rollback and keep the source history bundle
for provenance.

The owner manages the roster and PIN resets directly in the database. Multiple
devices signed into one player share that seat. The table displays the latest
100 hands while the server separately archives every completed hand. Settlement
calculates suggested transfers across completed games; it does not record payments.

## Test controls and production visibility

The shared client exposes practice, all-in previews and showdown previews only
when `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` is `staging` or `local`. Unconfigured development also
allows these controls; unconfigured builds and unknown environment names hide them.
Production must define `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production` at build time and
`APP_ENV=production` on the Worker. Client visibility is compiled into the build;
changing the runtime variable alone does not change the UI.

Simulated history controls also require the client test flag and server-reported
availability. The server independently rejects simulated history/settlement outside
staging and only processes history reset requests in staging. Practice and preview
hands run entirely in local browser state; they have no multiplayer endpoint.
This does not provision production or change the staging deployment configuration.
