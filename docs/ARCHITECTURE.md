# Architecture

Dunzo Club serves a React PWA and its multiplayer API from the same Cloudflare
Worker. Vinext/Vite builds the app. One SQLite-backed `ClubTable` Durable Object,
selected by the fixed name `dunzo-club`, coordinates the private group.

## Request flow

1. `worker/staging.ts` sends API and WebSocket requests to `server/worker-router.ts`; other requests go to the app renderer.
2. The router validates the origin and forwards to the group's Durable Object.
3. `server/club-table.ts` authenticates the player and serializes HTTP, socket callbacks and alarms.
4. `lib/protocol/poker.mjs` validates commands, including protocol version, unique command ID and state/hand guards.
5. `server/table-service.mjs` applies `lib/poker.mjs` rules within a storage transaction and saves the state, command receipt, archives and next alarm before acknowledgement.
6. Each socket receives a separately filtered snapshot. The browser ignores older state versions and retries unconfirmed commands with the same command ID.

Player actions use HTTP; WebSockets push snapshots and handle ping/resync.
Alarms drive action timeouts, runout voting and the next deal without connected clients.

## Storage

All multiplayer data lives in the same Durable Object's SQLite-backed storage.

| Record | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| SQL `players` | Stable UUID, unique name, salted PIN hash, account status and lockout state |
| SQL `player_sessions` | Hashed login tokens, expiry and authentication version |
| `active` | The sole active room code |
| `room:<code>` | Full authoritative room, including the private deck and current hand |
| `command:<player>:<id>` | Payload signature and acknowledgement for retry deduplication |
| `hand:<code>:<number>` | Completed hand archive |
| `session:<code>` | Completed session results, independent of the active room |
| SQL `history_examples` | Isolated simulated history, available only in staging |

The D1/Drizzle files preserve the original hosting integration and are not used
by the multiplayer coordinator. Local Wrangler state is separate from deployed data.

## Rules and invariants

- Chips are integers. Buy-ins, stacks and cash-outs must reconcile.
- Only one session is active. Seat claims and buy-ins commit together.
- The engine handles NLH, PLO4 and PLO5; Omaha uses exactly two hole cards and three board cards.
- Shuffling uses cryptographic Fisher–Yates with rejection sampling.
- Side pots follow contribution levels. Uncalled excess is returned; odd chips are distributed deterministically.
- Two runouts require every eligible voter to choose Twice and enough undealt cards. Missing choices default to Once.
- Payout animation deadlines are enforced by the server before another deal or pending termination.
- `view()` removes the deck, hides unrevealed cards and sealed votes, and aliases other players' IDs. Never broadcast the stored room directly.
- Four-digit PINs use salted PBKDF2 hashes. Login sessions use HttpOnly cookies and expire after 30 days; changing a PIN revokes other sessions.

## Client and presentation

`app/page.tsx` coordinates the table. Lobby, history, runout voting and chip motion
have separate components. `lib/table-presentation.mjs` defines shared timing;
`lib/use-table-effects.ts` and `lib/poker-audio.ts` handle browser effects.

`lib/client/poker-client.ts` owns multiplayer transport and pending-command recovery.
Only explicit practice mode runs the engine in the browser, through
`lib/client/practice.mjs`. Practice does not write multiplayer storage.

The service worker caches install assets only. Private game responses stay on the
network. History and settlement use India calendar dates; suggested transfers
aggregate completed sessions and apply the Dunzo/Ishita offset first.

## Verification

`pnpm test` covers rules, presentation, transactional server behavior, authentication
and history. `pnpm test:staging` checks readiness and deployment guards. The local
smoke runner checks HTTP/WebSocket play, restart recovery and independent alarms
using disposable storage. See [deployment instructions](CLOUDFLARE_STAGING.md)
for the build and release commands.
